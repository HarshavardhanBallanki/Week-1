<h2>🌍 Carbon Emissions Prediction - Week 1</h2>

Internship Program: Edunet Foundation x AICTE x Shell – AI 4 Weeks Internship
Week 1 Task: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
Tool Used: Jupyter Notebook
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy

<h3>📝 Task Overview</h3>

In Week 1 of the project, I focused on data preprocessing and data cleaning as a crucial initial step for building a robust carbon emissions prediction model. The raw datasets were analyzed, cleaned, and structured to ensure consistency, accuracy, and readiness for further analysis and modeling.

<h3>📁 Files Included</h3>

climate_change_download_0.xls – Original raw dataset

data_cleaned.csv – Final cleaned dataset after preprocessing

<h3>🔧 Work Done</h3>

Loaded raw Excel and CSV data files using pandas

Removed or imputed missing values

Converted data types where necessary

Dropped irrelevant or duplicate columns

Handled outliers and standardized formats

Saved cleaned dataset to data_cleaned.csv for use in future stages

<h3>📊 Libraries Used</h3>

pandas – For data manipulation and handling

numpy – For numerical operations and missing value handling

<h3>💻 Tools & Environment</h3>

Jupyter Notebook (local environment)

Python 3.x

<h3>📌 Next Steps</h3>

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Selection & Training

<h3>🚀 Credits</h3>

This project is part of the AI 4 Weeks Internship by Edunet Foundation in collaboration with AICTE and Shell.
